Things to distinguish between:

- test/generate to controller
- test/generate can be used for streaming rates... for general controller (batch jobs), we can drop that.

So:
 - stats for batch jobs can be ridiculously simple. Each job can be reported separately to stdout with latency.
 - stats for latency sensitive ones are much more complex.

Testing now:

Phase 1. Local testing.
 - Pub/Sub topic/subscription pairs *with* auto ack and without
 - Test it out in a basic wa to ensure it is working (things turning over) properly
 - We should see the non-exactly once config working far smoother

Phase 2. Terraform and at scale.
 - Apply retry config, min extension period, use exactly once.
 - Ensure it works smoothly at e.g. 1000 pods and watch it for a bit. See if you can get some stats on scalability.
 - Try it without exactly-once configuration and see how it goes.
