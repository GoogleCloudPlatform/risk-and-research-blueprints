Things to distinguish between:

- test/generate to controller
- test/generate can be used for streaming rates... for general controller (batch jobs), we can drop that.

So:
 - stats for batch jobs can be ridiculously simple. Each job can be reported separately to stdout with latency.
 - stats for latency sensitive ones are much more complex.
